                    <p className="mb-2">Ocelot Consulting was formed in 2016 by four former software engineering colleagues at a large St. Louis-based corporation. Their goal was to share the transformational lessons learned (Agility, Cloud, Security, DevOps) with other companies in the region.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2"><strong>You will notice the difference working with a company that was founded by technologists and is run by technologists. It is a refreshing, no-nonsense approach to solution delivery that our clients appreciate.</strong></p>
                    <p>That customer satisfaction has fueled our growth as we continue to expand our presence regionally and nationwide.</p>

                    <p className="mb-2">We appreciate that every company is at a different spot in its transformation journey. Our expertise is in understanding where our clients are, where they want to go, and collaborating on a practical plan to get there.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">We understand that sometimes this change must be incremental, and we will never try to force a technology or solution that our clients are unable to consume.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">Transformation requires comprehensive change management that includes engaging and partnering with client Enterprise Architecture, Program Management, Information Security, and Application Development teams.</p>
                    <p><strong>We are uniquely prepared to provide recommendations and lessons learned from real-world implementations.</strong></p>
