                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-4">The Challenge</h2>

                            <p>The client’s business is growing.  An existing plant breeding process and genetics-based decision pipeline were no longer able to support the volume and throughput required which could result in products being delayed to market.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-4">The Solution</h2>

                            <p className="mb-2">Ocelot was brought in to simulate alternate breeding pipelines and to build new decision analytics on top of simulated data sets.  Provided evidence that a particular change can make the process faster without sacrificing quality.</p>

                            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                                <li>Implemented software models of plant breeding decisions</li>
                                <li>Created a model of plant breeding biological processes through a mix of custom and 3rd party software</li>
                                <li>Implemented a plant breeding pipeline simulation tool that allows the user to experiment with new plant breeding operational processes and variations on key decisions while measuring impact on costs and product quality</li>
                                <li>Implemented a data science model to improve a specific key decision at the start of the breeding pipeline</li>
                                <li>Implemented an RShiny application to quickly put the new data science model in the hands of the plant breeders</li>
                                <li>All simulation experiment results are written up in R Markdown and versioned in client’s Gitlab</li>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-4">Successful Results</h2>

                            <p>Simulations demonstrated multiple decision and pipeline changes can reduce costs and result in a faster time to market without a reduction in quality of products.</p>
