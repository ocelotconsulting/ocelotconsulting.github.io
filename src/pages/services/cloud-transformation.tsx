                        <p>If you think just moving workloads to the cloud will lower costs, you may be sadly mistaken. Similar capabilities could cost more – potentially much more, if not managed properly. Significant savings are still possible by intelligently architecting solutions and designing for elastic usage. Ocelot can help you navigate this landscape to maximize your return on investment.</p>
