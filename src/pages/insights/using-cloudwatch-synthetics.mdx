# Using Cloudwatch Synthetics with Private Endpoints

## Introduction and Use Case

With the release of [Cloudwatch Synthetics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-cloudwatch-synthetics-to-monitor-sites-api-endpoints-web-workflows-and-more/),
AWS has added a powerful tool for organizations to leverage that was previously 
the exclusive domain of third party monitoring solutions.  On its face, they serve to add
visibility to publicly exposed endpoints, whereby a Lambda acts as a "user" consuming
some part of an application.  

While this is useful for traditionally-public types of applications, many
Enterprises today have built robust capabilities that, due to compliance and
regulatory compliance, are only accessible within small subsets of their corporate
network.

In this article, we'll take a look at how to leverage AWS
Cloudwatch Synthetics using VPC endpoints that monitor an internal serverless
application hosted on a private API Gateway.

**Key Considerations for this approach:**

- The use of VPC endpoints restricts all of our traffic to the internal AWS
network.  
- We are exposing a single API Gateway endpoint, but use the `X-APIGW-API-ID` header
to delineate which lambda is invoked behind the gateway
- Security Groups further restrict allowed traffic.  In this case, a security
group is created specifically for our Canaries, limiting egress to only our 
VPC endpoints

Before we set up our synthetic monitor, it is important for the reader to
understand some of the terms and assumptions as part of this exercise.

### What Are Synthetic Transactions

Synthetic Transactions go beyond simply measuring whether a web service is up
or down.  They also provide insight into specific, logical units of work that
an application performs.  They are designed to mimic what an actual user of the
application would do during the course of their session.

For example, a synthetic transaction might attempt to query or insert random data
into a database.  If written correctly, calling this transaction not only tells
you that a web server is available, but also that it can successfully connect
to the database and perform insert operations.  

In the event that any of the aforementioned steps failed, ideally the endpoint
would respond with the relevant, non-200 HTTP code, along with a description of
what failed.

We can also use timing data to gain insight into how software development has
impacted our performance.  By running the same transaction consistently, across
version releases, it is easy to correlate releases with impacts to performance.
Furthermore, it makes it easier to troubleshoot perceived performance impacts, as
you can empirically assert performance characteristics between releases.

### Pre-requisites

Before proceeding to the next section, ensure you have the following pieces of
information.

**Required Information**

- The URL of the VPC endpoint exposing the APIs.  Refer to [the documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-amazon-api-gateway-private-endpoints/) for how to set up private VPC endpoints
- The ID of the API you intend to use
- The URI of the API
- The Subnets in which the API Endpoint is located
- A security group that allows egress on port 443 to the VPC Endpoint

### Setup

With the information you collected in the last section, we can configure our canary.
To start, navigate to the Cloudwatch console and select *Canaries* under the
Synthetics section in the left navigation.

1. In the *Create Canary* page, select "Use a Blueprint" and the "API Canary" blueprint.

1. Fill in a name for your canary

1. For *Method*, we are using an `HTTP GET`.  However, you also have the option to use `HTTP POST` and include a request body.

1. For Endpoint URL, enter the VPC Endpoint URL, along with the URI for the API. E.G. `https://vpce-0333bf622cf2d1363-af7t5lpt.execute-api.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com/dev/health`

1. For *Key*, enter `x-apigw-api-id` for the name, and the API ID in the value.

1. Under *Schedule*, select *Run Once*.  

You can leave the other values at their default setting for now.  Click *Save* 
and wait for the canary to be created.  The canary will run once, and **will fail**,
because we still need to update the IAM Role to allow the Canary to describe
network interfaces.  Once that is done, we can then modify the canary to use
a VPC and subnets.

1. Navigate to the IAM console and find your newly created role.  It will be prefixed with `CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-`.

1. For demonstration, we can simply modify the attached policy to include the necessary EC2 permissions.

1. Add the following actions and save the policy

```json         
"Sid": "VisualEditor2",  
"Effect": "Allow",  
"Action": [  
    "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",  
    "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",  
    "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",  
    "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"  
],  
"Resource": "*"  
```

**Private Endpoint Configuration**

1. Go back to your Canary in the Cloudwatch console.

1. Under the *Actions* menu, select *Edit*

1. Scroll down and expand the *VPC Settings*.  Fill in the details with the information you looked up for the VPC Endpoint

   - Select the VPC in which your VPC endpoint resides
   - Select the subnets in which your VPC endpoint is deployed
   - Select a security group that allows traffic to the VPC Endpoint

1. Scroll up to the *Schedule* section, and select *Run Continuously*.  Select an interval - currently health checks are scheduled to run on 5 minute intervals.

1. Save the canary.

Once the Canary is saved, it will begin running on the interval you set.  After
a few minutes you should see the canary running successfully:

### What you actually built

The Synthetics Canary is simply a wrapper that does the following things:

- Creates a lambda function with an existing AWS Synthetics layer in NodeJS
- Creates a bucket for logging
- Creates a new Cloudwatch Metrics namespace called *CloudWatchSynthetics*
- Cloudwatch Alarms (if you configured them in the GUI)
- An IAM role with a policy

#### The Synthetic Lambda

The lambda created as part of the Canary is mostly NodeJS boilerplate, with 
custom options automatically added from the data you supplied when you set up the
canary.

There are two layers:

- Generic synthetic layer provided by AWS
- A custom layer dynamically built based on your configuration.

{/* {: .posts-center} */}
![Synthetic Lambda](/assets/insights/2020-05-20-using-cloudwatch-synthetics/synthetic-lambda.png)

To find the code, navigate to the Lambda console and search for your canary.  It
takes on a name of the form `cwsyn-<canary_name>-<uuid>`.  The first layer is
standard across all canaries - it is maintained by AWS and bootstraps our function
to provide logging, custom metrics and handle failures.

To view the code in the custom layer, navigate to the *Layers* section in the
left hand navigation.  Search for the canary layer you created, which takes on
the same naming structure as the function.  Click "Download" and open it in an editor.

You also have the option of exporting the function as a SAM model, which you can
customize to fit your needs.

### Custom Metrics

As part of using the Synthetic Canary, custom metrics will be emitted to a new
namespace called *CloudWatchSynthetics*.  The two dimensions available are on
a per-canary basis, as well as an aggregate across all canaries.

Each canary has three metrics:

- Duration
- Failed
- Success Percent

It is important to note that **Failed** values indicate a **non-200 return code**,
and are not measuring the failure of the lambda service itself.


## Alarms & Thresholds

Configuring an alarm based on static thresholds is common, and outside the scope
of this document.  However, a useful new feature in cloudwatch called *Anomaly
Detection* can be set on the *Duration* metric, and you can configure alarms
based on that.

*Anomaly Detection* is a form of machine learning that trains itself on up to 
two weeks of data points.  It is useful for detecting deviations from expected
behavior, which is calculated based on past results.

To configure useful anomaly detection in Cloudwatch, graph your *Duration* metric,
and select *Maximum* for the statistic.  Set the period to 15 minutes.  Add
*Math Expression->Anomaly Detection->Calculate Band*.  You'll see a new row with
an expression similar to `ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND(m1, 2)`

The first value is a reference to the metric you are using.  The second value is
the number of standard deviations from the mean in which to qualify a value as
falling either within or outside of the detection band.

**To get an accurate anomaly band, you must allow the model to train on data for
several days, up to a week**.  When you first configure this, you will likely see
an ultra-wide band.  For example, with just a handful of data points running around
60-80ms, the band went from -30seconds to 30seconds.  Over time this becomes
more precise, and should eventually look similar to the following screenshot.

### Handling Cold Starts

Due to the Lambda architecture, occasionally your health check will run much longer
than normal.  To help filter these out, be sure to set the period of your graph
to an interval that includes more than one sample.  For instance, in this example,
our health check runs on a 5 minute interval, and we are graphing with a period of
15 minutes.  

Combined with a Cloudwatch alarm configured to activate if it detects multiple
data points in a row, this can help to avoid false positives that are due to
cold starts.

## Conclusion

Here, we've successfully configured a Cloudwatch Canary to monitor an application
health check on a fixed interval, and only raise an alarm when response times are
considered outside of the expected "normal", which also serves to reduce alarm
fatigue on an operations team.

We also saw how the Cloudwatch Console can be used to automatically generate
boilerplate code for us to use, along with custom metrics.  An operator need not
have a background in NodeJS to leverage this capability.

Provided that an application has relevant health checks built into it, over time,
this information can be used to ascertain performance characteristics and trends
over time.
