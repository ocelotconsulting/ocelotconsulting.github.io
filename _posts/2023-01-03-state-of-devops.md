# State of DevOps

With 2022 behind us, DORA - that is, [DevOps Research and Assessment](https://dora.community) - has released their [2022 State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2022_state_of_devops_report.pdf), a thorough, 77-page PDF on DevOps as it impacts the success of software development. Sounds like an easy read, right? Well despite it being well written, there's a few important points that can be pulled out and discussed in context of where we see clients and organizations at today on their path to their goals and visions. Specifically, there are three major callouts that we see happening often.
