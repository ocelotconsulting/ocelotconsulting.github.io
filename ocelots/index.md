              <h2 class="subtitle subtitle__spacing-small">
              Ocelot was founded in 2016 by a small group of engineers who worked together at a large corporation here in St. Louis. Having successfully helped that company modernize on multiple fronts - agility, modern web development, migration to public cloud, DevOps, APIs and microservices - they saw an opportunity to share those experiences with other companies in the region.

              <h2 class="subtitle subtitle__spacing-small">
              From day one, our mission has been to help clients modernize by meeting them where they are, showing them what's possible, and helping them get there. Every company's starting point is unique to them. Some are moving their very first workflows from on-premise to the cloud. Some are investing in upgrading their security or removing dependencies on legacy platforms. Regardless of where they are currently, we strive to help them improve.

              <br/>
              <h2 class="subtitle subtitle__spacing-small">
              Innovation requires constant interaction, feedback, and pivoting that is best achieved by working together. We send a small group of Ocelots to combine with client employees to build a team together. In doing this, our technical experts are training and coaching as much as they are building. We care about developing talent and developing our clients as much we care about developing software.

              <h2 class="subtitle subtitle__spacing-small">
              What makes our model work is the talent of our consultants. While we do have some of the most experienced software engineers and cloud architects in the region, we value more than just experience. We look for employees who thrive working in a team environment. We enjoy coaching and mentoring and celebrating the success of the team over individual accomplishments. We are continual learners - willing and anxious to learn new technologies and help clients realize how they can be leveraged.
              It's not easy to find individuals with all of these talents. The good news is - when you do, they are some of the best people you would ever want to work with. It makes for an amazing team and a rewarding work environment. Whether you're a senior architect or a junior engineer, nothing will accelerate your career faster than surrounding yourself with exceptionally talented colleagues who care about you.
