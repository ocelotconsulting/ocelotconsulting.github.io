    Utilizing experts in application modernization and cloud migrations, Ocelot was able to work on multiple client goals at once. Working with the client, Ocelot was able to help take existing legacy desktop tools and rearchitect them using browser technologies and deploy them to their existing on-premise servers. This allowed the client to quickly see the positive effects of the change. Users were now able to access these tools from any browser as well as see improvements in performance and usability. Simultaneously, other Ocelots were able to help establish an AWS cloud environment. Among the initial proofs of concept provided for the client, Ocelot helped to develop a Cloud based Data Lake with automation built for data ingestion and metadata generation. This not only showed the client the potential and benefits of using the cloud but provided a strong base for further development and migrations to make use of data already present in the cloud.

  <div class="padding-top-1">
    As the initial proofs of concept were being completed and the client was seeing the level of success they could achieve, more teams and business units wanted to get involved and leverage the new technologies. This came with its own set of concerns though. With each team and business unit having their own processes and ways of working it quickly became apparent that there needed to be some standardization across the wider organization for handling cloud migrations and modernizations. Luckily, Ocelot was able to help the client take what was learned in the early initiatives and generate standards and best practices which could be adapted and adopted by other groups in the organization.

    In addition to helping provide common templates and standards of best practice, Ocelot helped to establish a centralized Cloud Operations team to aid in broader adoption of the cloud and modern technologies across the organization. This team has helped to ease the initial hurdle of getting started in the cloud and that has helped numerous teams get up and running much faster than previously possible.
