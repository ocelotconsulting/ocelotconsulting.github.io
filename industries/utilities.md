    The first major initiative that Ocelot was able to help the client with was the initial set up of proofs of concept in the cloud as well as the design, creation, and sharing of best practices for ensuring security and performance in the cloud. In order to make this process repeatable and automated, Ocelot helped to build and deploy a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline using a Cloudbees Jenkins cluster with various other tools like Artifactory, Hygieia, Github Enterprise, Sonar, and AWS XRay. These tools coupled with standardized processes and procedures allowed for the adoption of a full Blue/Green deployment strategy thus making deployments smooth and seamless to the users.

    The second goal that Ocelot was able to help with was migrating the clients' data infrastructure from on premise servers to AWS Cloud. The client utilized a suite of Informatica Data Analytics tools to power their applications and wanted to be able to continue to utilize that after migrating to the cloud. This task proved to be significantly more complex than was initially anticipated. However, developers from Ocelot never gave up. They continued to work the problem and participated in quite a few coworking sessions with client developers as well as Informatica support personnel. This persistence paid off and the full suite of Self-Aware Informatica Data Analytics tools used by the client on premise were successfully migrated and utilized in AWS Cloud.

    Now that Ocelot had helped the client successfully establish standards and best practices for working in the cloud as well as aided in migrating their data and analytics infrastructure, the client was ready to start utilizing it all to improve their existing applications. With the help of Ocelot, the client was able to successfully migrate their primary public website to AWS. Additionally, Ocelot built and deployed a Energy Efficiency Portal to production to AWS using S3, Cloudfront and API Gateway which the client is able to use to better track and manage data about their provided services.
