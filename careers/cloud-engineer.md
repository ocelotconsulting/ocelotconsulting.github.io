# About Us

Ocelot Consulting was born out of an idea that autonomy and mastery are worthy goals of good engineers. We had an idea that the classical devops organization could be made more efficient and pleasurable to work in if run in ways that engineers valued. Ocelot works to innovate and inspire devops pros to try new things, applying them to client needs to solve today's biggest problems.

We aim to give our Ocelot family challenging and rewarding work, competitive compensation and the opportunity to make their role into everything they want it to become. The establishment of a collaborative community of experts is the goal we aim to integrate all new team members into.
