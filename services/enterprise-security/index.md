		<h3>The last several years has seen more need for personal information transparency and the ability to track information more than ever. To compliment consumer privacy requests, 
		legislation has been passed that dictates how customer information must be handled and secured. Sarbenes Oxley (SOX), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
		and even Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have dramatically influenced the information technology landscape and require a new level of data security and audit capabilities.
